# Sparse Echo State Networks in Tensorflow-GPU

Code to build sparse ESNs allowing fast computations on GPUs in form of Tensorflow-layers.
Optional: Alternative training via linear regression e.g. when backpropagation is not effective / efficient. 
The main.ipynb file in the Notebooks folder demonstrates the usage for predictions of spatio-temporal systems by data driven modeling exemplary on the KS-Equation.
